I got here in 2015, and I started my BBQ journey about the same time. I also dabble in mixing up my own rubs. I've got a few I'm pretty proud of.<br /><br />I also enjoy using my cookers (I've got 3 for now) for all sorts of things: meat, cheese, salt, even pizza!<br /><br />I don't just cook for myselfâ€”that would be boring! I cook for my whole family, my lovely wife and our four chaotic kids. |
