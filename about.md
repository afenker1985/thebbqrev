| ![The BBQ Rev](/assets/the-bbq-rev-round.png#float-left) | I'm a pastor serving in Kansas, the heart midwest BBQ. I dabble in mixing up my own rubs. I've got a few I'm pretty proud of.<br /><br />I also enjoy using my cookers (I've got 3 for now) for all sorts of things: meat, cheese, salt, even pizza!<br /><br />I don't just cook for myselfâ€”that would be boring! I cook for my whole family, my lovely wife and four chaotic kids.  |
